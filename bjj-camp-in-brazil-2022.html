						<p>After our visit to Belo Horizonte, we will travel to Salvador Bahia State to Morro de São Paulo, one of the most beautiful and safest destinations in Brazil. It’s home to palm-fringed beaches and is lined with stores and restaurants. After a flight to Salvador, we will travel by catamaran from Salvador to Morro de Sao Paulo and experience the beauty of the Brazilian coast. </p>
						<p>In Morro de São Paulo, you will stay at the highly-rated Hotel Portaló. With a beautiful sea view and an unforgettable sunset, Hotel Portaló offers its guests cozy chalets, apartments and suites, as well as a panoramic pool overlooking the ocean.</p>
						
						<p><img src="images/ftc-team-logo.png" id="ftc-team-logo" alt="FTC Team Logo"/>In the hotel, Professor Marcelo Oliveira will conduct 2-hour drilling sessions and review everything that was taught at the other academies. You will have an intense jiu-jitsu training session in the morning and relax on the gorgeous beaches of Morro de São Paulo in the afternoon. You also have the opportunity to visit the splendid village, eat lunch at local restaurants, or spend the afternoon in the hotel pool.</p>
						
						<p>On our last day, we will take a private boat to Boipeba Island, one of the islands of the Tinharé archipelago. Surrounded by the ocean on one side, and the Inferno River estuary on the other, this island is of rare natural beauty, home to a great variety of ecosystems. The island has been recognized by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve and as a World Heritage Site. </p>
